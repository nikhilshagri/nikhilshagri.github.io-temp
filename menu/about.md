title: Hi!

My name is Nikhil Shagrithaya. I am a first year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, advised by [Prof. Mahdi Cheraghchi](mahdi.ch). I am mostly interested in topics in theoretical computer science. Specifically, I'm interested in computational complexity, coding theory, and the analysis of Boolean functions.

Previously, I completed a masters at IIT Kanpur, where I was advised by [Prof. Rajat Mittal](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/rmittal/), and I completed my undergrad at the LNM Institute of Information Technology.

Prior to working in theoretical computer science, I was really into working with memory safe languages, such as [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), and even contributed to [Servo](https://servo.org/), an experimental web engine written using Rust.
